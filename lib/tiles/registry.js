/**
 * THE REGISTRY - the list of tiles on this board.
 *
 * This is move 2 of adding a tile. The file lands in tiles/, then it gets one
 * line here, and the board renders it. That is the whole registration.
 *
 * Each entry:
 *   id    a short stable slug. THIS IS THE STORAGE KEY. Never change it after
 *         data exists under it, or the tile boots empty and its history is
 *         orphaned. Renaming an id is a data migration, not a rename.
 *   name  what a human calls it. Safe to change any time.
 *   file  the path to the tile's html, relative to index.html.
 *   size  how much grid it takes. One of:
 *           s     1 wide, 1 tall
 *           m     2 wide, 1 tall
 *           tall  1 wide, 2 tall
 *           hero  3 wide, 1 tall
 *           big   2 wide, 2 tall
 *           band  4 wide, 1 tall
 *           l     4 wide, 2 tall
 *         (matches lib/tiles/tileSkin.ts SIZE_PRESETS on Vitality)
 *   page  optional, true = the grid shows the tile's poster face and tapping
 *         it opens the same file full screen (the host adds '#page' so the
 *         file knows which layer to render).
 *   data  optional, path to a JSON file in this repo that automation writes
 *         (e.g. 'tiles/data/finance.json'). The host fetches it and hands it
 *         to the tile as a feed. Sealed tiles cannot fetch; this is the pipe.
 *
 * Ships empty on purpose. An empty board is the seed. Every tile from here is
 * theirs, added one at a time.
